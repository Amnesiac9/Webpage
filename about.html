                    Mars is a chocolate lab and is just under 4 years old, born in late May.
                    She is a very full of energy dog and loves to play frisbee. She is very friendly and loves to meet new people.

                <br>
                <li>
                    Her favorite toy is a frisbee and she loves to play fetch. She is great at catching the frisbee and will do it all day if you let her.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    She knows how to sit, lay down, shake, <strong>wave</strong>, play dead, bow, spin, and stand. She is very good at listening and will do anything for a treat.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    She can be protective and sometimes barks at people coming into our home, she might seem tough at first, but she could not hurt a fly. She is very sweet and loves to brush up and lean on you, so be careful and don't get nocked over!
